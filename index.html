    <p>“The Mystery Black Box,” which is literally what the point of this box is. We were given a fully covered container with a Mechanism that allowed the water flow to behave the way it did. As a group, we had to hypothesize the agency's structure based on the outcome. Based on my experiment, I can determine that there is a possibility that the “greedy glass” method is inside the box.

    <h1>EVIDENCE </h1
    <p>The black mystery box has three main components: the input, the output, and the internal structure. For example, we had put 500 ml of water into our information, and 450 ml of water came out. This was a consistent pattern we often saw as we increased the amount of water we put into our box. As the amount of water increased, the amount of water out decreased.
