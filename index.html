    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>“The Mystery Black Box,” which is literally what the point of this box is. We were given a fully covered container with a Mechanism that allowed the water flow to behave the way it did. As a group, we had to hypothesize the agency's structure based on the outcome. Based on my experiment, I can determine that there is a possibility that the “greedy glass” method is inside the box. 
</p>
    <h1>EVIDENCE </h1
    <p>The black mystery box has three main components: the input, the output, and the internal structure. For example, we had put 500 ml of water into our information, and 450 ml of water came out. This was a consistent pattern we often saw as we increased the amount of water we put into our box. As the amount of water increased, the amount of water out decreased. 
 </p>
    <h1>REASONING </h1
    <p> A model is an illustration or representation that describes a process, conception, or event. Before testing the product, we created models and diagrams to help establish our thoughts and Ideas. One of the main components in our model was the greedy glass, a piping method that has loops to slow the flow of water. Using these components allowed us to identify specific characteristics of our model.Based on the graphs and charts provided, we can see that my evidence supports my initial claim. When observing the table, we can tell that as the amount of water that goes in the input increases, the amount of water that comes out decreases—proving that our theory of the greedy glass can be accurate.
Additionally, we conducted multiple trials to verify our reliable information and kept all quantitative data consistent. If the data differed, I believe my initial statement was incorrect. Because the pace of the water is a significant factor in our results, and because the greedy glass method purposefully causes the flow of water to decrease, an alternative approach would've proved the opposite. </p>
